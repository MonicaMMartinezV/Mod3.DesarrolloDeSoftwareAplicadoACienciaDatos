## Overview:
This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to preparing the CIFAR-10 dataset for deep learning tasks using PyTorch. It covers the essential steps of data loading, exploration, normalization, and augmentation that are crucial for effective model training.

## Data set information:
CIFAR-10 is a well-known computer vision dataset consisting of 60,000 images total (50,000 training, 10,000 test), 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck), 32×32 pixel resolution with 3 color channels (RGB) and Balanced distribution across all classes, which is something extremely useful as we do not have to make any extra adjustments for uneaven rows/columns in the data set.
